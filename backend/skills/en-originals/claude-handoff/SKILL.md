## Instructions

> **Provenance.** Adapted from `mattpocock/skills → skills/in-progress/claude-handoff` (MIT, vendored at `vendor/upstream-skills/mattpocock/skills/in-progress/claude-handoff/SKILL.md`).
> Changed for this repository: frontmatter fields (`tags` / `triggers` / `allowed_tools` / `author` /
> `version`), path conventions (`docs/specs`, `docs/tickets`, `work/<scope>`), tool names
> (`read_file` / `write_file` / `edit_file` / `bash` / `grep` / `glob` / `task`), and a verification floor
> section. Upstream's `disable-model-invocation` has no equivalent here — every skill is discoverable
> through the `skill` tool, so it is dropped rather than emulated.


Write a handoff summary of the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save it to the temporary directory of the user's OS, then launch a background agent seeded with it as its prompt: `claude --bg --name "<descriptive name>" -- "$(cat <summary file>)"`. Passing the file keeps the shell from running backticks or expanding `$` in the summary. It starts in the current working directory and returns immediately; the user manages it with `claude agents`.

Always pass `-n`/`--name` with a descriptive name (e.g. `--name "Fix login bug"`); it sets the display name shown in the job list, session picker, and terminal title.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the summary, naming which skills the next agent should call the `skill` tool for.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information, since the summary becomes the agent's prompt.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the summary accordingly.

## This repository's floor

- **Verify with the real commands**, not by eye: `./scripts/housekeeping_verify.sh` (guards + `tsc` +
  `vite build` + a document-store report). Add `--full-suite` for the backend suite.
- **The backend suite has 20 pre-existing failures.** "Not worse than that baseline" is the honest
  criterion; "the tests are green" is not a claim you can make here. Compare with
  `pytest tests -q --ignore=tests/test_neo4j_document_enrichment.py --ignore=tests/test_pageindex_full_content_loader.py`
  and diff the `FAILED` lines against the recorded baseline.
- **Specs, tickets and notes live in files**: `docs/specs/<slug>.md`, `docs/tickets/NNN-<slug>.md`,
  `work/<scope>/`. A verdict in a chat message is lost by the next turn.
- **Ecosystem layer**: agent code is LangChain (`create_agent`) inside a LangGraph runtime, usually wrapped
  by a Deep Agents harness (`deepagents`). Decide which layer the change belongs to before writing it — the
  `lc-ecosystem-primer` rule — and prefer the highest layer that does the job.
