# Setup Git Guardrails

Sets up a PreToolUse hook that intercepts and blocks dangerous git commands before Claude executes them.

## What Gets Blocked

- `git push` (all variants including `--force`)
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -f` / `git clean -fd`
- `git branch -D`
- `git checkout .` / `git restore .`

When blocked, Claude sees a message telling it that it does not have authority to access these commands.

## Steps

### 1. Ask scope

Ask the user: install for **this project only** (`.claude/settings.json`) or **all projects** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)?

### 2. Copy the hook script

The bundled script is at: [scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh](scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh)

Copy it to the target location based on scope:

- **Project**: `.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`
- **Global**: `~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`

Make it executable with `chmod +x`.

### 3. Add hook to settings

Add to the appropriate settings file:

**Project** (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Global** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the settings file already exists, merge the hook into the existing `hooks.PreToolUse` array. Don't overwrite other settings.

### 4. Ask about customization

Ask if user wants to add or remove any patterns from the blocked list. Edit the copied script accordingly.

### 5. Verify

Run a quick test:

```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git push origin main"}}' | <path-to-script>
```

Should exit with code 2 and print a BLOCKED message to stderr.

## This repository's floor

- **Verify with the real commands**, not by eye: `./scripts/housekeeping_verify.sh` (guards + `tsc` +
  `vite build` + a document-store report). Add `--full-suite` for the backend suite.
- **The backend suite has 20 pre-existing failures.** "Not worse than that baseline" is the honest
  criterion; "the tests are green" is not a claim you can make here. Compare with
  `pytest tests -q --ignore=tests/test_neo4j_document_enrichment.py --ignore=tests/test_pageindex_full_content_loader.py`
  and diff the `FAILED` lines against the recorded baseline.
- **Specs, tickets and notes live in files**: `docs/specs/<slug>.md`, `docs/tickets/NNN-<slug>.md`,
  `work/<scope>/`. A verdict in a chat message is lost by the next turn.
- **Ecosystem layer**: agent code is LangChain (`create_agent`) inside a LangGraph runtime, usually wrapped
  by a Deep Agents harness (`deepagents`). Decide which layer the change belongs to before writing it — the
  `lc-ecosystem-primer` rule — and prefer the highest layer that does the job.
